## Build

There are different ways to compile and run an AIR application for BlackBerry 10. This README will focus on the use of the command line tools. Feel free to check the [other possibilities](http://developer.blackberry.com/air/)

Prepare the BlackBerry 10 environment as described on [their documentation site](http://developer.blackberry.com/air/documentation/bb10/install_the_ph_platform_blackber_2006017.html).
Namely:
*   Download and install the [Adobe Flex SDK 4.5](http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/Downloads) or later.
*   Download and install the [BlackBerry 10 SDK for Adobe AIR](https://developer.blackberry.com/air/download/)
*   Download and install [VMware Player](http://www.vmware.com/products/player/) for Windows or [VMware Fusion](http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/overview.html) for Mac.
*   Download and install the [BlackBerry 10 Simulator](https://developer.blackberry.com/devzone/develop/simulator/simulator_installing.html)

Keep track of the location of the BlackBerry 10 SDK for Adobe AIR as it will be needed soon.

Download the [Lightstreamer distribution](http://www.lightstreamer.com/download) and copy the `Lightstreamer_as_client.swc` file from the Lightstreamer Flex Client SDK (that is located under the `DOCS-SDKs/sdk_client_flex/lib` folder) into the `lib` folder of this project.

Being $BB the folder where your BlackBerry 10 SDK for Adobe AIR was installed, run

```
$BB/bin/amxmlc -library-path+=lib/Lightstreamer_as_client.swc -source-path=src -output=StockListDemo.swf -- src/stocklistdemo/StockListDemo.as
```

a new `StockListDemo.swf` file will be created containing your air application 

### Package and Run

Start the BlackBerry 10 Simulator and take note of the IP address (check the bottom-left of the window the simulator is in)

Being $BB the folder where your BlackBerry 10 SDK for Adobe AIR was installed and $IP the IP address of the simulator, run

```
$BB/bin/blackberry-airpackager -package StockListDemo.bar -installApp -launchApp -device $IP -forceAirVersion 3.1 -ane $BB\frameworks\libs\qnx\ane\QNXSkins.ane StockListDemo-app.xml bar-descriptor.xml StockListDemo.swf icon_image.png logo.png
```

A new `StockListDemo.bar` file will be created and deployed on the simulator. Note that the application will also be automatically launched.
